export const projectDescription = "Global marine biodiversity supplies essential ecosystem services to human societies. Marine plankton ecosystems fuel ocean productivity, drive global biogeochemical cycles and regulate the Earth's climate. Climate-mediated loss of biodiversity has been suggested to negatively impact ocean ecosystem services, but future projections of climate change impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem function are poorly constrained due to a lack of observational data. Hence, policy makers lack quantitative evidence on the vulnerability of marine ecosystems. The MArine Plankton diversity bioindicator scenarios for policy MAKERs project is a collaboration between IUCN Global Marine and Polar Programme and ETH Environmental Physics Group (UP) to inform data-driven decision-making on marine biodiversity protection at the international policy level and was financed through the Geneva Science Policy Interface (GSPI). Based on observational data and novel machine learning algorithms we have mapped the biogeography of 859 plankton species. We defined ocean biomes, projected future changes in biodiversity and identified hotspots of diversity change. The interactive web tool for policy makers visualizes the results on a global map and is the first step in narrowing the gap between science and policy makers in regard to plankton diversity and their impact on ecosystem functions to be incorporated in marine management decisions.";

    // Diversity indices
    'Biomes':
        "The biomes were constructed based on yearly distribution maps of plankton species' presence derived from statistical species distribtuion model ensembles. This procedure was developed by Urs Hofmann Elizondo (2021) and partitions the open ocean into ecologically relevant biomes based on plankton species biogeography using self-organizing maps and hierarchical clustering.",
    'Species Richness':
        "Species richness displays the percentage of species present in regard to the selected plankton group. To display this biodiversity index, the habitat suitability index had to be transformed to presence and absence entries. To do so, we used the cut off threshold of the True Skill Statistic which was derived from the species distribution models. To convert each species to a presence or absence entry we use three trhesholds, namely the 25th, median and 75th percentile, derived from three different SDMs (Generalized Linear Model, Generalized Additive Model, Neural Network) that computed five evaluation runs each. We add the presences and computed the average of the new presence table.",
    'Hotspots of Change in Diversity':
        "This change in diversity is derived from the presence-absence converted data. To assess the change from the beginning until the end of the 21st century, we used a base diversity estimate that has been averaged over a period of eighteen years (2012-2030) that was subtracted from each year, 2012 - 2100. Therefore it shows the yearly difference in the relative number of species when comparing to our base diversity estimate and gives information on how species richness is about to change until the end of the century in regard to the chosen RCP emission scenario.",
    'Habitat Suitability Index (HSI)':
        "The Habitat Suitability Index (HSI) hypothesizes species-habitat relationships and is a numerical index that represents the capacity of a habitat to support a selected species. The species distribution framework used in this analysis was developed by Righetti et al. (2019) and Benedetti et al. (2018) to estimate plankton diversity patterns from an ensemble forecasting approach using three different algorithms namely Generalized Linear Models, Generalized Additive Models and Artificial Neural Networks. Depending on the group that is selected, the HSI has been summed up and divided by the total number of species in that particular group in order to scale it between zero and one. It therefore represents the averaged HSI for each group selected.",
    'Change in HSI':
        "This change in diversity is derived from the Habitat Suitability Index. To assess the change from the beginning until the end of the 21st century, we used a base Habitat Suitability Index estimate that has been averaged over a period of eighteen years (2012-2030) that was subtracted from each year, 2012 - 2100. Therefore it shows the yearly difference in the Habitat Suitability Index when comparing to our base Habitat Suitability Index estimate and gives information on how much this index is about to change until the end of the century in regard to the chosen RCP emission scenario.",
    'Species Turnover':
        "The species turnover represents the change in species composition compared to the species composition in the year 2012. We used the Jaccard Index, which results in a value between zero and one. High values close to one represent similar or identical species composition as in the year 2012.",
